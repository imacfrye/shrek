	<h1>shrek</h1>
	<p><strong>All Star by Smash Mouth</strong></p>
	Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me<br>
	I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br>
	She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>[Pre-Chorus:]</strong><br>
	Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>
	Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
	Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
	Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
	So much to do, so much to see So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
	You'll never know if you don't go You'll never shine if you don't glow
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>[Chorus:]</strong><br>
	Hey, now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play<br>
	Hey, now, you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid<br>
	And all that glitters is gold<br>
	Only shooting stars break the mold
	<br>
	<br>
	It's a cool place and they say it gets colder<br>
	You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older<br>
	But the meteor men beg to differ<br>
	Judging by the hole in the satellite picture<br>
	The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br>
	The water's getting warm so you might as well swim<br>
	My world's on fire.<br>
	How about yours?<br>
	That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>[Chorus 2x]</strong><br>
	<br>
	Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas I need to get myself away from this place<br>
	I said yep, what a concept I could use a little fuel myself<br>
	And we could all use a little change<br>
	Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>
	Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
	Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
	So much to do so much to see So what's wrong with taking the back streets<br>
	You'll never know if you don't go<br>
	You'll never shine if you don't glow.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>[Chorus:]</strong><br>
	<br>
	And all that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>[END]</strong>
